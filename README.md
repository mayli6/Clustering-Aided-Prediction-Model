# Clustering Aided Prediction Model
This project involves a set of historical housing transaction data in King County from May 2014 - May 2015. Clustering techniques are first used to group data based on similar characteristics, then predictive models are trained on each clustered sub-datasets. Three clustering techniques, i.e. K-means, Hybrid and Fuzzy C-means, as well as three predictive algorithms, i.e. XGBoost, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network are included in this study. By matching each predictive algorithm with all clustering methods, nine clustering aided prediction models are developed and their forecasting accuracies are proven to be improved as compared to the base prediction models.
